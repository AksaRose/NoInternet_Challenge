# GitHub Repo Word Counter

A web application that calculates the total number of words in a GitHub repository and estimates the time it would take to type them based on your typing speed.It will compare your typing speed and the time you used to type the code, checks whether the code could be typed within specific time (here, 5 hrs). Build to check suspicious entries during Tinkerhub's NO Internet challenge. The app provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for performing this analysis.
